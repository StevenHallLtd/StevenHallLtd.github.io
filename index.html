          A video chat app for iOS featuring a variety of single and multi-user
          modes, with videos able to be broadcast live on TV or recorded for
          later use. An accompanying web app allows the configuration and
          moderation of live chat rooms, review and handling of recorded
          sessions and basic user&nbsp;admin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both the iOS app and the accompanying web app were built
          simultaneously by myself using React, React Native, Twilio Video and
          Firebase analytics, authorisation, cloud functions, realtime data and
          storage in around twelve weeks, including some significant changes to
          functionality along the&nbsp;way.

          Another prototype explored how these collectibles could be created

          adjusted and scored. Built with React, Material UI and ThreeJS in
          four&nbsp;weeks.
